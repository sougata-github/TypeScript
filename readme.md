# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it provides type-safety and static type checking.

Statically Typed languages: Data-type of variable is known at compile time. Programmer has to assign the data-type of variable at the time of it's declaration.
Dynamically Typed languages: Data-type of variable is assigned during run-time by interpreter, depending on its value.

TypeScript is a development tool, project still runs JavaScript.

<i>Syntax:</i>
let variableName: type = value;

To run a .ts program:

``tsc fileName.ts
<br/>
``node fileName.js

First step is called transpiling where the typescript compiler(tsc) transpiles the TS to JS. Transpiling is the process of converting the source code from one programming language to another. It is often used in web, especially with languages like TypeScript, JSX which are not directly supported by web browsers.
